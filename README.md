# Sudoku Game
This is a game I made for fun while I was on holiday in Lapland

## Requirements
- .NET SDK

## Installing
- Clone the repository
- Go to the Sudoku/ directory and run **`dotnet build -c Release`** or build it in Visual Studio
- Go to the build directory and execute the game binary, `Sudoku.exe`

## Instructions
Use the arrow keys to move the cursor
Use keys 1-9 to set the value of a tile and 0 to erase.

Each column, row and 3x3 box must contain numbers from 1-9, you know how sudoku works right?

Press `c` to run commands, `help` for help

Enjoy!
